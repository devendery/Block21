# Phase 1: Completion & Commit

We are locking the current state as **Phase 1: Core Feel & Visuals**.

## 1. Scope of Commit
*   **Physics:** Direction-Inertia Steering, Screen-Space Input, Physics/Visual Separation.
*   **Visuals:** Obsidian Sovereign Skin (Hex Head, Red Core, Grey Shell), Organic Tail Taper.
*   **Architecture:** React Refs for Phaser mounting.
*   **Exclusions:** No Boost, No Death (these are deferred to Phase 1.5).

## 2. Action
I will now formally acknowledge this state as the baseline for all future development. No file changes are needed to "commit" in this context other than marking our internal checklist complete.

**Next Step:** Proceed immediately to Phase 1.5 (Boost & Death).
