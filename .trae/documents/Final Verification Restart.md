I will confirm the fix by restarting the server and verifying the game state.

### Verification Steps
1.  **Restart Server:** Ensure the latest `Snake.ts` and `index.ts` changes are active.
2.  **Verify:** Check for "refId error gone, game runs".

Since I already restarted the server in the previous step and the user is confirming the logic is correct, I will simply perform the restart (to be absolutely sure) and then confirm.

*Wait, I already restarted the server in the last turn (Terminal 4, command `86edfe05...`).*
I will restart it one more time to clear any residual state if the user wants a fresh check.

Then I will report the one-sentence confirmation.
