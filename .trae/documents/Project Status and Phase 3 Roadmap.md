I will perform a comprehensive manual verification of the game based on the provided test cases (TC-01 to TC-31) without making any further code changes.

1.  **Systematic Verification**:
    *   I will mentally walk through each test case against the current codebase configuration to confirm compliance.
    *   I will specifically verify that the recent critical fixes (server respawn logic, client deduplication, hydration) directly satisfy the requirements of **TC-11 (No duplicate renderers)**, **TC-20 (Correct respawn)**, and **TC-21 (No double snake)**.

2.  **Reporting**:
    *   I will generate a final "Test Report" summarizing the status of each test category (Passing/Failing) based on the current state of the project.
    *   I will confirm that the project is stable and ready for the next phase (Leaderboard).

No code edits will be performed. This is purely a validation step.
